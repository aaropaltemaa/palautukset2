For Python, there are numerous tools for linting. One of these being PyLint. According to the site's documentation, PyLint is "a static code analyser for Python 2 or 3". The software is designed to analyse your written code without actually running it. Main features of the application include, for instance, error checking, standardized syntax, as well as suggestions on refactoring the code. It essentially removes all the headache regarding the application's maintainability.

As for testing, the pytest framework is a notable candidate. Whether it's applications or libraries you're working with, pytest has it covered. For building, there are many Python-supported tools, such as setuptools and poetry. Both of them are suitable for preparing software to run on the platform where it's intended to run - that is, depending on your desired configuration settings.

There are many alternatives for setting up Continuous Integration besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions. GitLab CI/CD, for instance, is integrated directly into GitLab repositories. In addition, it is great for end-to-end DevOps with built-in Docker registry, and provides a YAML-based configuration (.gitlab-ci.yml).

Given the size of the team and the project's scope, a cloud-based CI/CD setup is likely more efficient and cost-effective than managing infrastructure for a self-hosted solution.
